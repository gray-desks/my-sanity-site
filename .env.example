# Sanity Configuration
SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-sanity-project-id
SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-sanity-api-token-with-write-permissions

# Instructions:
# 1. Copy this file to .env
# 2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual Sanity credentials
# 3. Get your project ID from https://sanity.io/manage
# 4. Create an API token with Editor permissions from your project settings
# 5. Never commit .env to version control - it's already in .gitignore
